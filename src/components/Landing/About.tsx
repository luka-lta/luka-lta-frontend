                I'm a passionate full stack developer with experience in building web applications
                using modern technologies. I love solving complex problems and creating intuitive
                user experiences.

            <p>
                When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to
                open-source projects, or enjoying outdoor activities.
